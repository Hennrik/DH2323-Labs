# DH2323-Labs
There three labs' codes of the course Computer Graphic and Interaction
In order to run these codes successfully, you'd better install SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) and GLM(OpenGL Mathematics ) first. otherwise, you cannot find some header files or definded namespace.I hope that will help you.It is just a test of this update function.---------------------------------------
